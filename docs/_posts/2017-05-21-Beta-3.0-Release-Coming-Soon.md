Expect beta 3.0 to be released in the next days!

We are currently testing the second release candidate of beta 3.0 and I am working on the linux port.  
If there are no major bugs that require fixing, the new version should be out tomorrow or the day after.

Since the program was completely rewritten since beta 2.9.1 the new version should be way more performance efficient.  
Also you can expect some cool new features like a name generator or a character overview.  

I am also working on updating the wiki but to be honest, that is really time consuming and could take some days as releasing the new version has a higher priority.
