Beta 3.0 has just been released!

It can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/PhilInTheGaps/GM-Companion/releases/tag/0.3.0.0).  
It is now possible to use an installer for the Windows version and it is available for 32 bit or 64 bit systems.  
But for those of you who don't want to install it, downloading a .zip for running the program without installation is also possible.

Unfortunately GNU/Linux users currently don't have that choice. I was just not able to create a working .deb package for a simple installation.  
That does not mean there won't be one in the future but because I am still new to developing for Linux systems that will take some time...  
I hope that one day there will be a repository to install it via apt-get.  
Until that day you will have to use the .tar.gz package, extract it and run the "gm-companion" runtime.  
I will post more detailed instructions to the [wiki](https://github.com/PhilInTheGaps/GM-Companion/wiki/Installation).

With the change from Java to Qt5/C++ I am unfortunately no longer able to provide a version for "Mac OS X" Systems, as I don't own such a device.

Anyways, I hope you enjoy this version of the "GM-Companion"!  
And if you do indeed find a bug, click _Help->Report a Bug_ and it will take you to the "Issues" page of the GitHub repository where you can describe your problem.  
I will try to fix it as soon as possible.
