Beta 3.1 has been released!

This update introduces a notes system, translation support and improves the UI.  
Custom Qt-StyleSheets are supported as well.  

It also introduces the concept of addons for specific rpg systems.  
This feature is still under development and will have more features in the future.  
Currently there are two addons available:  
- DSA5 (The Dark Eye, though currently only available in German)
- SIFRP (A Song of Ice and Fire Roleplaying)

Official addons for other systems will be available in the future and there will also be an Addon-Creator for you to create your own addons.  

Addons can add system specific units to the unit converter, notes and the SIFRP addon enables a SIFRP House Generator.  
Again, this will change in future updates.  
Addons can be installed with the AddonManager via the new "Options" window.  
The AddonManager is written in Java and also WIP.  

I no longer provide a .deb package to install the GM-Companion on Ubuntu systems, use the Launchpad repository instead.  
I figured out how to let the program build from git, which allows me to provide the GM-Companion for amd64 systems from Ubuntu 16.10 upwards.  
Older versions are unfortunately not supported, as well as 32-bit systems, though that might be possible in the future.
