[General]
KingsLanding="Liege: Robert Baratheon, King of the Seven Kingdoms \nThe very place where Aegon the Conqueror began his campaign to conquer the Seven Kingdoms, King’s Landing has become the seat of power and center of trade throughout the Seven Kingdoms. King’s Landing is the cultural and political heart of Westeros. It is from here that King Robert, sometimes called the Usurper, rules the entirety of the Seven Kingdoms from his mighty castle, the Red Keep. While King’s Landing is but a city, a number of noble houses swear fealty directly to the crown and the capital of the land. Houses sworn to King’s Landing benefit from a slightly higher population, improved law, and defenses due to their proximity to the Iron Throne. However, they are almost all smaller, weaker, and less influential than other houses."
Dragonstone="Liege: Stannis Baratheon, Lord of Dragonstone \nThe former seat of House Targaryen, Dragonstone is an ancient castle festooned with dragon carvings that rises from the narrow sea beyond the Blackwater Bay. When King Robert awarded Dragonstone, a lordship of small influence and few banners, to his brother Stannis, it was viewed as an insult. There are few houses sworn to Dragonstone. Isolation and lack of arable lands make houses sworn to Dragonstone small and poor, but the rocky islands and remoteness make besieging them difficult."
TheNorth="Liege: Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell,  Warden of the North \nUntil Aegon the Conquerer, the Kings of the North ruled this realm. Faced with annihilation, the last king knelt before the Targaryen warlord and swore fealty to their line. Easily the largest of Westeros’ realms, it also cleaves closest to the ways and customs of the First Men. Thinly populated, much of the North is an untamed wilderness punctuated by the occasional castle or keep and littered with the ruins of another age. Houses in the North have greater holdings than do their southron counterparts, and because Lord Stark is the Warden of the North, those sworn to him have slightly more influence than their rivals. The North, though, is a poor land, sparsely populated and frequently plagued by wildlings that come over the Wall. "
TheIronIslands="Liege: Balon Greyjoy, Lord Reaper of Pyke \nConsisting of seven islands spread throughout Ironman’s Bay, the Iron Isles are home to a fierce people who, for generations, subsisted by raiding and pillaging. While others may view such activities with revulsion, the ironborn celebrate them as their way of life and custom. Only through superior numbers of the rest of the Seven Kingdoms have the ironmen been brought to heel, but such a hold over them is tenuous at best. Like vicious dogs, they attack if they sense a weakness, and should the Seven Kingdoms falter, there can be no doubt that Lord Balon Greyjoy and his ironborn will once again take to the seas, bent on rapine and plunder. It is, after all, their way. The Iron Islands are strong and defensible, but defeat during Greyjoy’s Rebellion has diminished this realm’s influence in the Seven Kingdoms. "
TheRiverlands="Liege: Hoster Tully, Lord of Riverrun \nThis area was originally held by the Riverlords of old, defeated long ago during the Andal invasion and later by the ironmen. A fertile realm, the riverlands form the heartlands of Westeros, from the edge of the Red Trident to the Mountains of the Moon, from the swamps of the Neck to the shores of the Gods Eye. Rolling farmlands, the waters of the Trident, and numerous other creeks and streams characterize this region. Verdant lands with countless streams and rivers, the riverlands enjoy an abundant population, and houses here have slightly larger holdings. However, the lay of the land makes defense difficult. "
TheMountainsOfTheMoon="Liege: Jon Arryn, Lord of the Eyrie,  Hand of the King, Warden of the East \nThe Mountains of the Moon spread through the eastern corner of Westeros, scratching the sky with their high, windswept peaks. Infested with savage and violent clans of mountain men, it is a wild place, scarcely kept under the control of its putative lord. One region shines brightest, however, and that’s the Vale of Arryn. Wrested from the old Mountain Kings of the First Men, the Vale of Arryn is now the seat of power for one of the purest Andal lines in Westeros and features the lands and holdings of House Arryn and those banners sworn to him. Banner houses sworn to House Arryn enjoy the benefits of the security the Mountains of the Moon provide, but there is little available land for new lords within the confines of the Vale. Furthermore, the mountain clans cause endless trouble for the people living here."
TheWesterlands="Liege: Tywin Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock, Warden of the West \Located west of the riverlands, the westerlands a hilly region is noted for its great wealth and power. Having numerous ports and countless mines, it wields a great deal of power and influence in the Seven Kingdoms. House Lannister, who governs these lands, is easily one of the greatest houses in Westeros and is strengthened all the more by its ties to the Iron Throne. "
TheReach="Liege: Mace Tyrell,  Lord of Highgarden, Warden of the South \nLike the riverlands, the Reach is an area of fertile country, but it is south of the westerlands. A place of frequent conflicts with the Dornishmen to the south, this realm serves as a border between the somewhat independent Dorne and the rest of Westeros. The most notable place in the Reach is Oldtown, which is known to be the oldest community in the Seven Kingdoms; it once served as the seat of the Faith, and it still houses the Maester’s Citadel. "
TheStormlands="Liege: Renly Baratheon, Lord of Storm's End \nThe stormlands are a stretch of land bounded by the Reach to the west, King’s Landing to the north, and Dorne to the south. Facing Shipbreaker Bay, it is a place of sometimes savage weather, hence the name. The stormlands were held in olden times by the Storm Kings, who were eventually defeated by a Targaryen bastard who was raised up and made lord of all those lands. "
Dorne="Liege: Doran Nymeros Martell, Lord of Sunspear \nThe lands of Dorne spread south of the Dornish Marches, a people far different from those of the rest of Westeros, differing in custom, blood, and heritage. Forged from the Rhoynar invasion long ago, Dorne maintained its independence and even resisted the Targaryen conquest. It wasn’t until a century later that this realm joined with the rest of the Seven Kingdoms, their loyalties ensured through marriage and alliance. Even though they swear fealty to the Iron Throne, they are very much a people apart from the rest of Westeros."

[Events]
1\description="Easily the worst possible result, your house suffered a terrible series of mishaps, disasters, and tragedies that nearly erased your family. Depending on the era, doom might be of a supernatural origin—a dreadful curse or an attack by horrors from beyond the Wall. In more recent eras, doom would be purely natural, combining the results of several downturns into one catastrophic setback. For a first historical event, your family might have clawed their way out of the ashes of a destroyed house, maybe being loyal retainers or even just smallfolk that seized the old lord’s holdings."
2\description="Your family fought a war or smaller conflict but was defeated, losing status, precious resources, and influence. If defeat is your first roll, your family might have been swallowed up by another house and forced to marry into a lesser branch until your original bloodline became all but extinct."
3\description="A result of catastrophe usually indicates a natural disaster, such as an outbreak of plague, blight, or drought, any of which can diminish your population and ability to control your lands. If catastrophe is your first historical event, it means your family may have gained their status through dubious or tragic means, perhaps replacing the previous lords who were wiped out during the catastrophe or were a lesser branch that rose in station as they inherited the holdings of their kin."
4\description="Inbreeding, fell secrets, disease, or mental defects can produce derangement and madness among any people of Westeros, including its rulers. A madness historical event indicates that a particular figure suffered from some insanity, producing unpredictable results, with positive or negative outcomes. Each resource increases by +6 and then decreases by –2d6, producing a range of +4 to –6. If this was your first result, your family was instead raised by an insane lord or king as appropriate to the period of your first founding."
5\description="An invasion or revolt marks a period of collapse, destruction, and ruin. Most of these results come from an external invasion, either from ironmen, clansman, or wildling raiders, or from an enemy house, but it can also stem from a period of inept rule that led to a widespread smallfolk revolt. Invasion/revolt as a first historical event means your house was born from the strife and came to power in the aftermath."
6\description="Your family was involved in some disaster, a scandal that haunts them still. Good options include spawning a bastard, incest, failed conspiracies, and so on. In the case of your first roll, the scandal created your family as a way of covering up the crime."
7\description="Either you suffered the results of treachery or you were involved in committing a treacherous act. In either case, the historical event stains your family’s name. Should treachery be your first result, you gained your house by means of some dark deed, possibly betraying another lord or noble."
8\description="Whether from a poor marriage, a downturn in trade, or a series of tragic losses in a conflict, your house entered a period of decline. If descent is your first roll, your house was probably born from a poor marriage—a desperate lord wedding his daughter to a merchant prince—or of a major branch becoming extinct, leaving the holdings to a lesser branch to rule."
9\description="Infrastructure describes a period of peace and prosperity, a moment in your house’s history remembered for growth and expansion. Whenever you get this result, choose two different resources and increase each by 1d6. If infrastructure is your first result, your house was born during a period of expansion under your lord or king’s rule."
10\description="An advantageous marriage, a great deed for a liege lord, or heroism in a decisive battle can all improve the fortunes of a noble house. If this is your first historical event, it indicates that your house was raised from the smallfolk by marriage or through some great act that warranted your elevation to a noble house. Otherwise, ascent indicates that your house participated in some key historical event that improved their fortunes."
11\description="Your family gained the favor of the king, their lord, the Faith, or from some other powerful body. As a result, their fortunes improved, and they climbed in standing. This favor might also result from the naming of a family member to the ranks of the Kingsguard or attaining the rank of Grand Maester or Great Septon. Should favor be your first historical result, the king likely raised your family to nobility."
12\description="You family achieved an important victory over their enemies. Foes could include ironmen reavers, a King-beyond-the-Wall, or a rival house. In any event, your family rose in prominence and power because of their victory. As an initial historical event roll, this victory was so great that your family was raised to nobility."
13\description="Your family produced a character of unspeakable cruelty and wickedness, a villain whose name is still whispered with dread. Such a character might have committed terrible crimes in his home, killed guests under his roof, or was simply just a bad person. A villain as a first roll usually wins this position by dint of his evil, possibly murdering a rival and seizing his lands or birthright."
14\description="A family wins glory through a military victory, personal achievement, or by a great act of heroism. Glory is similar to ascent, but it focuses on one figure in your family’s past. The result of this individual’s deeds advances your family’s standing in the eyes of its peers. Generally, glory as a first historical event should imply that your house was formed as a reward for the great acts of their founder. "
15\description="Your family fought and defeated an enemy, annexing their lands and holdings to their own. With such a victory comes the trouble of old loyalties, weakening your house’s hold and influence over the smallfolk. If conquest is your first historical event, you gained your noble status by defeating another lord or landed knight."
16\description="A windfall is a boon, a blessing that catapults your family into fame (or infamy). Possible results could be an advantageous marriage, a gift from the king, discovery of new resources on one’s lands, and more. If windfall is your first historical event, you won your lands by attaining a victory at a tournament, performing a great act, or something else of the like."
